## Installation

## Usage

### Multi-Selection Mode
- **Hold Ctrl** (or Cmd on Mac) **before selecting text** to activate multi-selection mode.
- While holding Ctrl, select text with your mouse. Each selection will be highlighted.
- You can make multiple, noncontiguous selections.
- **Ctrl+C** (Cmd+C) copies all selected texts using your chosen separator (newline, space, or bullets).
- **Ctrl+Z** undoes the most recent selection.
- **Ctrl+Y** or **Ctrl+Shift+Z** redoes the most recently undone selection.
- **Ctrl+Shift+L** toggles lock mode (prevents accidental clearing of selections).

- **Click anywhere without Ctrl** to clear all selections (unless locked).

### Default Selection
- If you do **not** hold Ctrl before selecting, the browser's default text selection and copy behavior is used.

## Configuration

- Click the extension icon to open the popup.
- Choose your preferred copy separator: Newline, Spaces, or Bullets.
- Enable or disable MultiSearch and CombinedSearch context menu options.
- Open the options page to set your modifier key (Ctrl/Alt/Shift) and highlight color.

## Notes

- Selections are stored per page and persist until the page is reloaded or cleared.
- Works on most web pages except Chrome Web Store and some system pages.
- Refresh tabs after installing or updating the extension.
- For advanced free-shape selection, double-click and use the modifier key as configured in options.
